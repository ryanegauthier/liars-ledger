# Changelog

## [0.10.0] - 2026-05-30

### Backend proxy + verified/ambiguous UI

- **`server/`** — Node.js/Express backend proxy, deployed to Render at `api.liarsledger.com`
  - `server/index.js` — Express server with CORS, rate limiting, health check
  - `server/providers/claude.js` — Claude Haiku 4.5 extraction, returns standard shape
  - `server/providers/mistral.js` — Mistral Small extraction, returns standard shape
  - `server/providers/congress.js` — Congress.gov proxy (appends API key server-side)
  - `server/providers/votesmart.js` — VoteSmart v2 JWT auth + auto-refresh (CORS blocked from browser — must go through proxy)
  - `server/render.yaml` — Render deployment config
  - All API keys moved to server environment variables — removed from extension
  - `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` env var restricts access to the extension's Chrome ID
- **`src/llm.js`** — proxy-aware request routing
  - Detects proxy vs direct mode based on endpoint URL
  - Proxy mode: sends `{articleText}` — server handles auth and model calls
  - Direct mode: sends full model request with API keys (dev fallback)
  - `AGREEMENT_THRESHOLD` lowered from 0.65 to 0.55 — catches claims that agree on core assertion but differ in supporting detail
  - Pronoun normalization in `jaccardSimilarity` — "He has called" and "Sanders has called" now score on content words, not subject
  - Prompt updated in all three locations (llm.js, claude.js, mistral.js): added deduplication rule — models told never to return the same person twice with different name formats
  - Separate `claudeEndpoint` / `mistralEndpoint` options — each provider routes independently
- **`background.js`** — verification metadata passed through to records
  - `_verification`, `_claude_claim`, `_mistral_claim`, `_similarity` now on each record
  - `memberJobs` passes `claudeEndpoint` and `mistralEndpoint` separately
- **`content.js`** — verified/ambiguous claim UI
  - `dual_verified`: green left border (3px), teal background tint, `✓ Verified Statement` label, green card top border
  - `ambiguous`: amber border, `⚠ Models disagreed` label, Claude and Mistral claims shown separately
  - `single_model`: plain italic claim, no badge
  - Detail panel mirrors same treatment with `✓ DUAL VERIFIED — CLAUDE & MISTRAL AGREE`
- **`manifest.json`** — added `liars-ledger.onrender.com` to `host_permissions`; removed direct `api.anthropic.com` and `api.mistral.ai` (now proxied)
- **DNS** — `api.liarsledger.com` CNAME → `liars-ledger.onrender.com` (DreamHost, propagating)

## [0.9.0] - 2026-05-17

### Bill matching fix + GovTrack URL fix

- **`src/api.js`** — two-pass bill relevance matching
  - Pass 1: `billMatchesTopic()` keyword category matching (19 topic buckets)
  - Pass 2: direct title substring match against LLM `search_terms`
  - Untitled amendments filtered out; bills deduped by URL/number
  - Keyword search capped at 6 most specific terms per member
- **`background.js`** — `_llm_search_terms` passed through to `api.js`
- **`src/api.js`** — `resolveGovTrackId` URL fixed to `unitedstates.github.io`
- **`src/llm.js`** — `anthropic-dangerous-direct-browser-access: true` header added

## Planned

### [0.11.0] — Freemium tier management
- Anonymous free tier: 5 scans/day via session fingerprint
- Pro tier: unlimited scans, Stripe subscription, JWT auth token
- Popup shows scan count remaining for free users
- Account creation via liarsledger.com (not in extension)
- Backend enforces limits; extension degrades gracefully on 429

### [0.12.0] — VoteSmart integration
- Educational API license obtained — JWT auth, CORS-blocked, must go through proxy
- Interest group ratings (NRA, ACLU, Chamber of Commerce, AFL-CIO, etc.)
- Issue positions and candidate questionnaire responses
- Historical key votes beyond 119th Congress
- VoteSmart candidate IDs added to politician dictionary

### [0.13.0] — GovTrack extended data
- Ideology scores (0.0 = most liberal, 1.0 = most conservative)
- Missed vote rates and committee assignments
- Historical roll-call votes back to 1990s

### [0.14.0] — Creator shareable graphics
- One-click image card: politician name, claim, voting record
- Twitter/X (1200×628) and Instagram (1080×1080) formats
- Canvas API, no server render, Creator tier feature

### [Future] — Firefox / Safari
- Firefox: `browser.*` shim in place; publish to AMO
- Safari: Xcode + Apple Developer account required

### [Future] — Privacy policy + Chrome Web Store listing
- Privacy policy at liarsledger.com/privacy
- Chrome Web Store: Productivity / News category
- Consider Firefox AMO simultaneous launch

### [Future] — State legislators via OpenStates
- Goal: empower voters to see what their politicians at *any level* are saying vs. voting
- Phase 1: add governors + all 50 state legislatures via [OpenStates API](https://openstates.org/)
  - New `server/providers/openstates.js` proxy (same pattern as `govtrack.js`)
  - State bill search and roll-call votes via OpenStates
  - Expand `lookup.js` name resolution to cover state legislators
  - Loosen LLM extraction prompt — include governors and state legislators by name
- Phase 2: local officials (mayors, city councils)
  - No consolidated API exists yet — likely manual curation or crowd-sourced data
  - Structured voting records at municipal level are largely unavailable
- No `manifest.json` host permission changes needed — all calls go through the existing proxy
